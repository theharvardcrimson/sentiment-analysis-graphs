Here is all the feedback I was able to think of: (from Julien)
Feedback

## feedback so far

- [X ] set initial topic to "wokeness index"
- [ ] show selected topics to the left of the graph
- [X ] y axis should start at -0.2 ish
- [X ] on second graph, make y axis standard across topics, or add some sort of transition when the topic changes
- [ ] on second graph, list the topics as a radio group instead of a dropdown
- [ ] some way to display the actual prompt used for each topic. i'm not really sure what the best way to do this is -- maybe, you could hover on one of the lines in the first group, and it would show a "show more" tooltip that displays the entire prompt? but this is pretty complex, and i'm fine if we don't get around to it

## Both graphs

- [ ] Most importantly, the years of missing data should be clearly visible on each graph. In previous Flourish figures, we have used dotted / dashed lines.
- [ ] The axis numbers, axis labels, button text, titles, etc. should all be in Georgia font (Crimson style)
- [ ] The colors should adhere to crimson style as well. See list of hex codes below.
- [ ] Incorporate flexibility for me to easily rename the titles / edit the captions.

## Graph 1

- [X ] Upon initial display, the “wokeness index” box should be selected.
- [ X] “Wokeness Index” should be renamed to “Aggregated Index” and should be moved so that it is the first/top box
- [ X] “Capitalism” Attribute should be renamed to “Anticapitalism”
- [ ] The “Selected Topics” checkboxes should appear vertically next to the Y axis of the graph.
- [ ] Caption that allows me to describe the methodology
- [ X] Y axis should start at -0.2 ish.
- [ ] X axis should have the year 2000 should be visible as a tick mark
- [ ] Mechanism to display the prompt for each topic on hover. Two options:
- [ ] A popup just below the cursor that has the text of the attribute prompt. Will probably need a “see more” button because each attribute prompt is like a paragraph.
- [ ] The attribute text appears on the right side of the graph, as well as a brief blurb explaining what it’s measuring. If we go with this version, it would be great it the text could fade in and fade out or have some other animation.

## Graph 2

- [X ] Most importantly: when the slicing changes, it is very deceptive to just have the labels on the axes change. There are two options:
- [X ] (Preferred) Include an animation that clearly indicates that the axes are being rescaled
- [X ] (Less preferred) Keep the axes fixed and only let the trend lines fluctuate.
- [X ] Get rid of the subdivision by attribute. It’s too confusing imo. That’s good for just graph 1.
- [X ] The “Filter by” dropdown should become a radio button with options displayed vertically on the left side of the graph, as in graph 1.
- [X ] The “Show All” option should be labelled as “Full Dataset”. This should also be what is selected upon initial display.
- [X ] When the “Full Dataset” option is selected, the single line displayed should be labelled as such.
- [X ] “Filter by” should be changed to “slice by”
- [X ] X axis should have the year 2024 visible as a tick mark
- [ ] Caption that allows me to describe the methodology
- [ ] Color scheme
